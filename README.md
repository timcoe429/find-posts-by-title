Quickly search blog post titles from the WordPress admin and jump straight to edit mode. Supports both Gutenberg and Classic Editor — no bloat, just speed.

== Description ==

Tired of scrolling through dozens (or hundreds) of posts to find what you need?

**Find Posts by Title** adds a simple search page under the **Posts** menu. Just type a keyword from the title and instantly see matching posts with links to:

- Edit in Gutenberg
- Edit in Classic Editor (if installed)

It’s perfect for blogs, news sites, and content-heavy installs where quick access matters.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`
2. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** menu
3. Go to **Posts → Find by Title**

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it work with custom post types? =  
Not yet — currently, it only searches the built-in `post` type. Future versions may add support for CPTs.

= Do I need to install the Classic Editor plugin? =  
No. The plugin will show the "Edit in Classic" link if Classic Editor is active. Otherwise, only Gutenberg will appear.
