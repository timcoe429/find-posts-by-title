Quickly search and edit blog posts by title from the WordPress admin. Lightweight, fast, and supports both Gutenberg and Classic Editor.

== Description ==

Stop scrolling through long post lists to find what you need.

This plugin adds a clean submenu under **Posts > Find by Title** that lets you search blog post titles from the admin and jump straight into editing — with links to open either the Gutenberg or Classic editor (depending on what your site supports).

Perfect for sites with hundreds of posts or fast content workflows.

* No clutter
* No bloat
* Just fast post finding

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to `/wp-content/plugins/` or install it via the Plugins screen in WordPress.
2. Activate the plugin.
3. Go to **Posts > Find by Title** in your admin menu.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this work with custom post types? =  
Not yet — currently it searches standard blog posts only. Support for custom post types may be added in the future.

= Do I need the Classic Editor plugin installed? =  
No — if it’s installed, you’ll see a link to edit in Classic. If not, you can just use the Gutenberg option.
