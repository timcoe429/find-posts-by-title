Perfect for sites with hundreds of posts or pages where quick access matters.

* Search posts and pages by title
* Native WordPress admin table styling
* Complete row actions (Edit, Gutenberg, Classic Editor, Trash, View)
* Alternating row colors for easy scanning
* Hover actions menu just like standard WordPress tables
* No clutter, no bloat — just fast content finding

**Locations:**
* **Posts → Find by Title** - Search blog posts
* **Pages → Find by Title** - Search pages

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to `/wp-content/plugins/` or install it via the Plugins screen in WordPress.
2. Activate the plugin.
3. Go to **Posts → Find by Title** or **Pages → Find by Title** in your admin menu.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this work with custom post types? =  
Not yet — currently it searches standard posts and pages only. Support for custom post types may be added in the future.

= Do I need the Classic Editor plugin installed? =  
No — if it's installed, you'll see a "Classic Editor" action in the row menu. If not, you'll just see the standard edit and Gutenberg options.

= Why does it look exactly like WordPress tables? =  
We use WordPress's native table styling and row actions to provide a familiar, consistent experience that matches the rest of your admin interface.
